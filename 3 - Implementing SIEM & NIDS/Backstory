Scenario: 555Labâ€™s CISO mandates the deployment of ELK + Wazuh (SIEM) and Suricata (NIDS) to enhance threat detection and response.

Goals:
Deploy ELK + Wazuh to collect logs from Windows Server, firewall, IDS, and endpoints.
Configure Suricata to monitor network traffic for anomalies.
Set up ELK + Wazuh dashboards for real-time threat analysis.
Implement alerting mechanisms for suspicious activity (failed logins, privilege escalation attempts).

Challenges:
    - Fine-tuning Suricata and Zeek rules to reduce false positives.
    - Ensuring log integrity and preventing tampering.

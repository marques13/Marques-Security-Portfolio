Scenario: 555Lab is transitioning to a virtualized infrastructure using Hyper-V. The network must be segmented into VLANs for security and efficiency.

Goals:
    - Configure Hyper-V virtual switches for VLAN tagging.
    - Implement VLAN segmentation:
        VLAN 10: Security subnet (SIEM, IDS, firewall).
        VLAN 20: Internal server subnet (AD).
        VLAN 30: Web server subnet (DMZ, public-facing services).
        VLAN 40: Client/corporate subnet (workstations).
    - Set up inter-VLAN routing via OPNsense.
    - Provide a network diagram detailing IP ranges, firewall rules, and traffic flow.

Challenges:
    - Preventing unauthorized lateral movement between VLANs.
    - Ensuring proper firewall rules for DMZ protection.

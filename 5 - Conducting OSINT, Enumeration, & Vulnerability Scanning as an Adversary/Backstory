Scenario: A threat actor is targeting 555Labâ€™s web server subnet. The attacker performs OSINT, enumeration, and vulnerability scanning to find weaknesses.

Goals:
    - Gather information about 555Lab employees via GitHub and company website.
    - Use Nmap to scan open ports on the web server subnet.
    - Run Nikto and OpenVAS to identify misconfigurations.
    - Simulate Attacks:
        1. Send a phishing email with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) to a client subnet user.
        2. Attempt lateral movement from the client subnet to the server subnet via a compromised sysadmin PC.

Challenges:
    - Detecting stealthy attacks before escalation.
    - Preventing privilege escalation on the sysadmin PC.
